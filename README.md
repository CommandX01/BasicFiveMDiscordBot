BasicFiveMDiscordBot 
A very simple FiveM/Discord Bot.
This Discord Bot Is Built For A FiveM Server (Was Originally Made For PSRP)
It includes a embed command that already templated for your fivem server, Just change as needed, and It includes a ip command (configurable) that sends the server ip when ever the command is executed, 

About Me      =      I am new to discord.py, and im still learning, this is a very simple bot, and I am working on adding a server status command (and/or it showing on its status), Sorry to dissapoint, but as I said, Im new and this is considered "big" for me as its my first release.


Installation:

1. Install the required modules (discord etc..) with: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2. Execute export DISCORDM=<token> to set an environment variable with your bot token
